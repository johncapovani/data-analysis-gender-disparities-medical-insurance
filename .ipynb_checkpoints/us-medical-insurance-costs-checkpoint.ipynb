    "Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This data analysis project aims to delve into a medical insurance dataset containing critical information about policyholders. By employing advanced data analysis techniques, the project seeks to uncover potential gender-based disparities in insurance costs. The dataset encompasses both categorical and numerical variables, including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and charges. Through a comprehensive analysis, this project will offer insights into the factors influencing medical insurance costs and provide valuable inferences on potential disparities between genders.\n",
